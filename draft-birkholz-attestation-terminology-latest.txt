1.  Introduction

   Over the years, the term attestation has been used in multiple
   contexts and multiple scopes and therefore accumulated various
   connotations with slightly different semantic meaning.

   In order to better understand and grasp the intend and meaning of
   specific attestation procedures in the security area - including the
   requirements that are addressed by them - this document provides an
   overview of existing work, its background, and common terminology.
   As the contribution, from that state-of-the-art a set of terms that
   provides a stable basis for future work on attestation procedures in
   the IETF is derived.

   The primary application of attestation procedures is to increase the
   trust and confidence in characteristics or specific attributes about
   two parties that intend to exchange data.  How a party's
   characteristics are attested and which characteristics are actually
   chosen to be attested varies with the requirements, or - in essence -
   the risk that is intended to be mitigated.  It is important to note
   that the activity of attestation itself in principle only provides a
   reliable basis for further activities that provide the semantic
   context of what an attestation procedures actually accomplishes and
   what it cannot.  Hence, this document is also intended to provide a
   map of terms, concepts and applications that illustrates the
   ecosystem of current applications of attestation procedures.

   Before an adequate set of terms and definitions for the attestation
   domain can be defined, a general understanding and global definitions

   of the "what" and the "how" have to be established.  In consequence,
   [enter final structure here].

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  Basic Attestation Roles

   The use of the term attestation always implies the involvement of at
   least two parties that each take on a specific role in corresponding
   procedures - the attestee role and the verifier role.  Depending on
   the characteristics attested and the nature of the parties,
   information is exchanged via specific types of interconnects between
   them.  The type of interconnect ranges from GIO pins, to a bus, to
   the Internet, or from a direct physical connection, to a wireless
   association, to a world wide mesh of peers.  In other words,
   virtually every kind communication path can be used by the two roles.
   In fact, a single party can take on both roles at the same time, but
   there is only a limited use to this architecture.

   Attestee:  The role that designates the subject of the attestation

   Verfifier:  The role that designates the appraiser of the attestee's
      attestation

   Interconnect:  A channel of communication between attestee and
      verifier that enables the appraisal of the attestee's attestation.

3.  Computing Context

   This section introduces the term computing context in order to
   simplify the definition of attestation terminology.

   The number of approaches and solutions to create things that provide
   the same capabilities as a "simple physical device" continuously
   increases.  Examples include but are not limited to: the
   compartmentalization of physical resources, the separation of
   software instances with different dependencies in dedicated
   containers, and the nesting of virtual components via hardware-based
   and software-based solutions.

   In essence, every physical device is a composite of components that
   are potential computing contexts capable of taking on the roles of
   attestee or verifier.  The scope and application of these roles can



Birkholz, et al.        Expires November 30, 2017               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              term-attestation                    May 2017


   range from continuous mutual attestation of every component in the
   hierarchy of the composite that constitutes a single distinguishable
   endpoint on the management plane, to sporadic attestation of the
   integrity of an experiment in earth orbit.

   Analogously, the increasing number of features and functions start to
   blur the lines that are required to categorize each solution and
   approach precisely.  To address that increasingly difficult
   categorization, the term computing context defines the
   characteristics of the entities that can take on the role of an
   attestee - and in consequence the role of a verifier.  This approach
   is intended to provide a stable basis of definitions for future
   solutions that continuous to remain viable long-term.

   Computing context :  An umbrella term that combines the scope of the
      definitions of endpoint [ref NEA], device [ref 1ar], and thing
      [ref t2trg], including hardware-based and software-based sub-
      contexts that constitute independent and distinguishable slices of
      a computing context created by compartmentalization mechanisms,
      such as trusted execution environments or virtual network security
      function contexts.

3.1.  Formal Semantic Relationships

   The formal semantic relationship of a computing context and the
   definitions provided by RFC 4949 is a as follows.

   A computing context:

   o  is a specific information system

   o  is an object and in consequence a system component

   o  is a composite of system entities

   Analogously, a sub-context is a subsystem and as with system
   components, computing contexts can be nested and therefore be
   physical system components or logical ("virtual") system components.

   The formal semantic relationship is based on the following
   definitions from RFC 4949.

   (Information) System:  An organized assembly of computing and
      communication resources and procedures - i.e., equipment and
      services, together with their supporting infrastructure,
      facilities, and personnel - that create, collect, record, process,
      store, transport, retrieve, display, disseminate, control, or
      dispose of information to accomplish a specified set of functions.

Internet-Draft              term-attestation                    May 2017


   Object:  A system component that contains or receives information.

   Subsystem:  A collection of related system components that together
      perform a system function or deliver a system service.

   System Component:  A collection of system resources that (a) forms a
      physical or logical part of the system, (b) has specified
      functions and interfaces, and (c) is treated (e.g., by policies or
      specifications) as existing independently of other parts of the
      system.  (See: subsystem.)

      An identifiable and self-contained part of a Target of Evaluation.

   System Entity:  An active part of a system - [...] (see: subsystem) -
      that has a specific set of capabilities.

3.2.  Characteristics of a computing context

   While the semantic relationships highlighted above constitute the
   fundamental basis to define the context of computing context, the
   following list of characteristics is intended to improve the
   intuitive understanding of the term and provide a better
   understanding of its meaning:

   A computing context:

   o  creates its own independent environment in regard to executing and
      running software,

   o  creates its own separate control plane state (by potentially
      interacting with other computing contexts) and can provide a
      dedicated management interface by which control plane behavior can
      be effected,

   o  can be identified uniquely and therefore reliably differentiated
      in a given scope, and

   o  does not necessarily has to include a network interface with
      associated network addresses (as required, e.g. by the definition
      of an endpoint) - although it is very likely to have (access to)
      one.

   In contrast, a docker [ref docker, find a more general term here]
   context is not a distinguishable slice of a computing system and
   therefore is not an independent computing context.

   Examples include: a smart phone, a nested virtual machine, a
   virtualized firewall function running distributed on a cluster of
   physical and virtual nodes, or a trust-zone.

4.  Attestation Workflow

   This section introduces terms and definitions that are required to
   illustrate the scope and the granularity of attestation workflows in
   the context of security automation.  Terms defined in the following
   sections will be based on this workflow-related definitions.

   In general, attestation is an iterative procedure that is conducted
   over and over again in a computing context under specific conditions.
   It is neither a generic set of actions nor simply a task, because the
   actual actions to be undertaken in order to conduct an attestation
   procedure can vary significantly depending on the protocols employed
   and types of computing contexts involved.

   Activity:  The condition in which things are happening or being done.
      In the scope of attestation, an activity is a sequence of actions
      that is intended to produce a specifically defined result.  The
      actual composition of actions can vary, depending on the
      characteristics of the computing context they are conducted by/in
      and te protocols used.  Example: The conveyance of cryptographic
      evidence is an activity or the acquisition of an trusted time
      stamp token are activities.

   Task:  A piece of work to be done or undertaken.  In the scope of
      attestation, a task is a procedure to be conducted.  Example: A
      Verifier can be tasked with the appraisal of evidence originating
      from a specific type of computing contexts.

   Action:  The accomplishment of a thing usually over a period of time,
      in stages, or with the possibility of repetition.  In the scope of
      attestation, an action is the execution of an operation or
      function in the scope of an activity conducted by a single
      computing context.  Example: Signing an existing public key via a
      specific openssl library, transmitting data, or receiving data are
      actions.

   Procedure:  A series of actions that are done in a certain way or
      order.  In the scope of attestation, a procedure is a composition
      of activities (sequences of actions) that is intended to create a
      well specified result.  Example: The activities of attestation,
      conveyance and verification compose a remote attestation
      procedure.

5.  Attestee Reference Use Cases

   This document provides NNN prominent examples of use cases
   attestation procedures are intended to address:

   o  verifying the source integrity of a computing context via data
      integrity proofing of installed software instances that are
      executed, and

   o  verifying the identity proofing of a computing context.

   These use case summary highlighted above is based in the follow terms
   defined in RFC4949:

   Identity:  [pull relevant rfc4949 parts here]

   Identity Proofing:  A process that vets and verifies the information
      that is used to establish the identity of a system entity.

   Source Integrity:  The property that data is trustworthy (i.e.,
      worthy of reliance or trust), based on the trustworthiness of its
      sources and the trustworthiness of any procedures used for
      handling data in the system.

   Data Integrity:  (a) The property that data has not been changed,
      destroyed, or lost in an unauthorized or accidental manner.  (See:
      data integrity service.  Compare: correctness integrity, source
      integrity.)

      (b) The property that information has not been modified or
      destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

   Correctness:  The property of a system that is guaranteed as the
      result of formal verification activities.

   Correctness integrity:  The property that the information represented
      by data is accurate and consistent.

   Verification:  (a) The process of examining information to establish
      the truth of a claimed fact or value.

      (b) The process of comparing two levels of system specification
      for proper correspondence, such as comparing a security model with
      a top-level specification, a top-level specification with source
      code, or source code with object code.

5.1.  The Lying Endpoint Problem

   A very prominent goal of attestation procedures - and therefore a
   suitable example used as reference in this document - is to address
   the "lying endpoint problem".

   Information created, relayed, or, in essence, emitted by a computing
   context does not have to be correct.  There can be multiple reasons
   why that is the case and the "lying endpoint problem" represents a
   scenario, in which the reason is the compromization of computing
   contexts with malicious intend.  A compromised computing context
   could try to "pretend" to be integer, while actually feeding
   manipulated information into a security domain, therefore
   compromising the effectiveness of automated security functions.
   Attestation - and remote attestation procedures specifically - is an
   approach intended to identify compromised software instances in
   computing contexts.

   Per definition, a "lying endpoint" cannot be "trusted system".

   Trusted System:  A system that operates as expected, according to
      design and policy, doing what is required - despite environmental
      disruption, human user and operator errors, and attacks by hostile
      parties - and not doing other things.

   Remote attestation procedures are intended to enable the consumer of
   information emitted by an computing context to assess the validity
   and integrity of the information transferred.  The approach is based
   on the assumption that if evidence can be provided in order to prove
   the integrity of every software instance installed involved in the
   activity of creating the emitted information in question, the emitted
   information can be considered valid and integer.

   In contrast, such evidence has to be impossible to create if the
   software instances used in a computing context are compromised.
   Attestation activities that are intended to create this evidence
   therefore also to also provide guarantees about the validity of the
   evidence they can create.

6.  Trustworthiness

   A "lying endpoint" is not trustworthy.

   Trusted System:  A system that operates as expected, according to
      design and policy, doing what is required - despite environmental
      disruption, human user and operator errors, and attacks by hostile
      parties - and not doing other things.
